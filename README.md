# Backend Developer Assessment
> This project implements a backend system for managing users and tasks (JWT), using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL.
- [(Node js Assignment.docx)](https://github.com/vivekjais1110/IMARC-GROUP/blob/main/Node%20js%20Assignment.docx)

# Features
- User registration and login.
- JWT-based authentication.
- CRUD operations for tasks.
- MySQL for relational data.
- Task prioritization and status management.
- Pagination and Filter.
- Node Mailer.

# Bonus Features: 
- Filter based report on the status of task. 
- Implement task deadlines notifications (send an email notification when a task is nearing 
its due date). 
- Implement pagination for retrieving the list of tasks. 

# Setup and Installation

```

# Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory.
Use the example below or customize as needed:
```sh
PORT=6000
JWT_SECRET=imarc
SQL_DB=imarc_group
SQL_USER=root
SQL_PASSWORD=root
SQL_HOST=localhost
SQL_DIALECT=mysql
```
# Start the server:
```sh
npm start
```

# Environment Variables
The project uses the following environment variables (found in .env):

- PORT: Port for the backend server.
- JWT_SECRET: Secret for signing JWT tokens.
- SQL_DB, SQL_USER, SQL_PASSWORD, SQL_HOST, SQL_DIALECT: MySQL database configuration.
